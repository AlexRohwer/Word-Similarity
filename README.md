# wordsimilarity
This is my final project for CS:2230 Data Structures.
Through the Java command-line, this program can be used to analyze the semantic similarity between words in any given text file and group them via k-means clustering.
This project uses opennlp.tools v1.8.3 for word stemming and a stopwords.txt file to ignore unneeded words, such as 'the', 'a', and 'so'.
